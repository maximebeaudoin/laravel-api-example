## Quick runtime environment to test the api
For convinience, we provide a `docker-compose.yml` file to quickly start a working environment. The file include `php-fpm`, `nginx
and a `mysql` database.

__Note__ : The application will run on `http://localhost:8000`. If you want yo change the port, simply edit the `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project.

### Environment variables
The first step is to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. The example file is already configure to work with the docker-compose.yml configurations.

### Commands to start the environment
```
## Launch containers
docker-compose up

## Migrate the dabase
docker-compose exec php  php artisan migrate:fresh
docker-compose exec php  php artisan db:seed

## Voil√† !
